# Documentation for Badges, Dots and Counters

## Badges

Badges are a way of displaying quantity. These are typically placed on top of, or next to other elements.

```HTML
<span class="zs-badge-counter">1</span>	
<span class="zs-badge-counter">12</span>
<span class="zs-badge-counter">123</span>
```
## Dots

Dots can also be used to bring attention to new or important pieces of information.

```HTML
<a href="#" class="zs-badge-dot">Brooklyn</a>
<p class="zs-badge-dot">Manchester, CT</p>
<span class="zs-badge-dot">Poughkeepsie</span>
```

## Counters

Counters are a text format for indicating how many items are contained within an element.

```HTML
<a href="#"><span class="zs-counter">20</span> Search Results</a>
<p>Announcements - <span class="zs-counter">9 New</span></p>
```
