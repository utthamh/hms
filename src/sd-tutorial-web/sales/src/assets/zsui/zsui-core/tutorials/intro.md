# Ecosystem 

![Git](./git_small.png) ![Bitbucket](./bitbucket_small.png) ![Nodejs](./nodejs_small.png) ![NPM](./npm_small.png) 

We use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for the source control of the library. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

To store Git repositories we use [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/zssd/). Bitbucket is a web-based hosting service used for source code and development projects that use Git revision control system. 

You probably have heard about [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Node.js is server-side JavaScript runtime built on Chrome V8 engine. Node.js has it’s own package ecosystem – NPM.

> ![Progressor](./progressor_speaks.png) Our Library uses Node.js and NPM as well. Learning Git, Node.js, NPM will help you become efficient Web developer.
